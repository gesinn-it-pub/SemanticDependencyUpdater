# Semantic Dependency Updater
Semantic Dependency Updater (SDU) is a MediaWiki extension that monitors pages for changes in their semantic data.
If a Semantic Dependency property is found, SDU will update (null-edit) all pages that have been selected through that property.

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SemanticDependencyUpdater for more details.
